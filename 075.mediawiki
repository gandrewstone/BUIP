BUIP075: Counter BUIP of BUIP071
Proposer: Gal Buki (@torusJKL)

==Summary==

This BUIP is the same as BUIP071 with the following change.

The text:

<blockquote>
Additionally, this BUIP, if passed, would give BU's Lead Developer the authority to provide a bespoke version of the "Bitcoin Core" branch for miners which creates empty SegWit blocks.
</blockquote>

is removed without providing any substitute.

Should BUIP071 remove the above text and not place another with the same meaning in its place then this counter BUIP can be revoked and not made available for vote.

==Conflict of interest==

The author holds some BTC but mainly BCH.
