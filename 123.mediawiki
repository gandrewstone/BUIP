== Summary==
A Bitcoin Unlimited member has recently participated in an online witchhunt against norway. Such an act endangers the personal safety of regular persons, and he has shown neither remorse nor ignorance about the potential consequences of his act. It is my opinion that continued membership of such a malicious individual impedes future activities of BU, and he should be removed from membership rosters.


==Proposal==


This BUIP will remove member Imaginary_username, from membership rosters as well as strip him of all voting powers immediately upon conclusion of voting.

IIn accordance with the rules clarified here: https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip116-articles-of-federation-adjustment.23726/page-2#post-91701, it must pass with a majority of votes (greater than 50%) with at least 50% of members voting OR a 75% super-majority of votes with at least 25% of members voting to take effect. If it does not take effect, another vote will be barred from proposal for the next 4 months.

this guy reminds me of stalin, what a jerk
