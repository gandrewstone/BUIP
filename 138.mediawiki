== Summary ==

For many years, I have contributed to Bitcoin Unlimited in my spare time as an unpaid volunteer. In September, I decided to "go pro" so that I could take a more active and hands-on role in research & development. It would be helpful if I were to receive a salary to partly compensate for the income that I am forgoing by not working elsewhere.

== Budget ==

This BUIP authorizes up to $100,000 USD a year (paid monthly in crypto) to fund my work. (This number was chosen in consulation with Andrew Stone and Andrew Clifford and is inline with the other BU developers).

== What I Intend to Work On ==

The majority of my work will focus on research & development towards new technology to allow blocks beyond 25 GB to be validated on low-cost hardware. I intend to release the first preview of what I've been working on towards the end of this month.

Funding this position will also make it easier for me to continue doing what I normally do, which is write articles to explain BU technology and initiatives, collaborate with other developers, carry out experiments, and organize workshops.

== Intellectual Property ==

Neither Bitcoin Unlimited, its members nor its officers have any claim of ownership to intellectual property that may result from my work on bitcoin, beyond that which I explicitly assign to BU. (This applies for all BU developers, but I wanted to state this explicitly)
