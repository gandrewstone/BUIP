==Motivation==

Bitcoin Unlimited needs a healthy voting participation.
Many members might not be very active on the forum and some have missed voting announcements.

==Objectives==

Implementing a system that will give people the possibility to check less often and still be able to know about all voting dates.

==Solution==

Voting dates will be published at least 12 months in advance. Members would need to check not more than twice a year and mark the dates for themselves.
Setting the dates remains the discretion of the secretary but there need to be a minimum of 4 dates per calendar year.
The blank-voting dates of Switzerland (https://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/vab_1_3_3_1.html) could be used as a reference.

==Task==

The BU Articles document, Article 2, IV will be amended with he following:

Voting dates are published at least 12 months advance notice on the BU communication channels. Each calendar year shall have no less than 4 voting dates spread over the whole year.
Dates can be removed if they are not yet within the advance notice window.
If there is no BUIP ready for voting on a predefined date than the voting will not take place and the date will not rescheduled.
The predefined dates can be used for votes, elections or both at the same date.
