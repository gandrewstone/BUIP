==Motivation==
Bitcoin Cash is advancing through decentralized development. Perhaps this was easier early-on, but now the dust has settled from the fork and a year has passed, there are many different voices pushing and pulling development priorities. The upcoming 15 November 2018 general upgrade is a major event, hence it would help if Bitcoin Unlimited, as an organization, had an official position on the major elements of the upgrade. This position is determined by the membership.

==Objective==

The purpose of the BUIP is to determine whether the BU membership supports creating the following new op codes in the scheduled November upgrade (this is a forking change).

==Summary of Proposed Changes==

Create new op codes:

OP_CHECKDATASIG and OP_CHECKDATASIGVERIFY

==Budget==

N/A

==Impact==

BU does not desire unintended forks in the BCH blockchain, so the BU client will remain compatible with the final specification of the November upgrade.
