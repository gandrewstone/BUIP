==Summary==
The purpose of this BUIP is to determine if BU is to continue to release clients supporting BSV HF of BCH

==Proposal==
BSV HF should no longer be supported by BU in future releases in the BCH client.

In the event that this BUIP passes, I will be charged with the task of making a PR that will remove BSV specific features from the BUCash client on Github.
Before my PR removing BSV specific features is merged, a new branch should named BSV should be made to preserve the current release with the BSV features. The new BSV branch will be a snapshot of the current dev branch unless it is deemed unstable by The Developer in which case the snapshot will be of the current release branch.
