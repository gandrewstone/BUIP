==Summary==
The purpose of this BUIP is to develop and maintain a public specification for the Bitcoin Cash protocol.

==Proposal==
This BUIP proposes that we use bitcoin unlimited funds to:
* Write a formal specification for Bitcoin Cash
* Maintain a formal specification for Bitcoin Cash

==Motivation==
Having a proper and full documentation is beneficial to all projects that needs to interact with the Bitcoin Cash network.

==Budget==
A maximum expenditure cap of $20,000 is proposed for the technical author work involved.
Due to the uncertain scope of the work, this is an estimate recommended by solex.

==Background==
Currently there is a lot of information on how Bitcoin and it's derivates operate, but it's shattered over a large number of resources and most of it is just descriptions of what the current codebases do.

While developing projects I've repeatedly found myself in need of a specification and have been referred to the concept that the code is the specification, which is unhelpful. An example of a currently poorly documented procedure is the Bitcoin Message creation and verification process.
