==Summary==

Bitcoin Unlimited was originally a group founded to let miners competitively decide the block size without any central organization of developers defining limits.

On Nov. 15, the original Bitcoin Cash chain forked, with the BCH side advocating for 32 mb blocks and the BSV side proposing 128 mb blocks with plans for totally removing any limit in the immediate future. In addition to upping the DOS limit, the BSV side has successfully stress tested 32+ mb blocks.

BSV's vision most closely coincides with Bitcoin Unlimited's vision of free competition, emergent consensus, and no delay in on-chain scaling. Consequently, this BUIP proposes to sell all BCH coins for BSV.

The trades would be carried out over the months January and February at the discretion of the President, Secretary and Lead Developer of BU (the three key holders). Coins will be stored in multisig wallets with keys held by the three BU officers at all points in time.

After the trades have been completed, the Secretary will report on the trades to the BU community (no less than 30 days after the last trade).
