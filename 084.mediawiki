==Background==

While many dedicated hardware and online wallets enable BCH splitting, no well-documented, open source tool / instruction set is readily available to guide users to independently and securely claim their BCH.

The absence of such a tool de-incentivizes security-minded long-term adopters from using the BCH network, especially in light of the present difficulty of transferring cold storage BTC to a wallet that enables splitting.

==Motivation==

To harness Bitcoinâ€™s network effect in favor of Bitcoin Cash by facilitating the separation of BCH from cold storage BTC, thereby promoting BCH usage.
To educate users about forking and wallet management.


==Task==

Document each step required for securely transferring BCH stored in a BTC wallet.dat file to a BCH address.
Document each step required for securely transferring BCH stored in a BTC paper wallet, paper key or redeemable code to a BCH address.
Explain any additional steps that may be taken for peace of mind (e.g. transferring the BTC to a fresh non-deterministically derived address after performing the split).
Post a comprehensive, detailed, fully-vetted primer on the BU website.


==Bounty==

A 0.25 BCH reward shall be paid to the author of the first version of the instructions delivered to an elected BU official that is deemed ready for a round of vetting by the membership.
0.25 BCH shall be reserved in case contracting any supplementary services (html coding, translation, etc.) is judged desirable by the leadership before publication on the BU website.


==Timetable==

Deliverable must be posted for comments no later than four weeks after BUIP approval in order to qualify for bounty.
